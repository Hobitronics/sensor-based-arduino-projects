## 📱 1. RGB LED Touch Color Selector

**Description**:  
This project uses a **metal touch sensor** to cycle through 8 beautiful colors on an RGB LED every time you touch it.

### 🔧 Components:
- Arduino UNO
- RGB LED (Common Cathode or Anode)
- Metal Touch Sensor Module
- Resistors (220Ω for RGB LED)
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard

### 🔍 Features:
- Cycles through 8 preset colors with each touch
- Uses PWM to control LED color mixing
- Debounced for stable interaction

### 📺 Demo:

## 🌟 2. Touch LED Brightness Controller

**Description**:  
Control the brightness of a single LED using a touch sensor! Each touch cycles through 5 brightness levels from dim to full brightness.

### 🔧 Components:
- Arduino UNO
- LED
- Metal Touch Sensor
- 220Ω Resistor
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard

### 🔍 Features:
- 5 levels of brightness (0 to 255)
- PWM used to control LED intensity
- Simple and intuitive interface

### 📺 Demo:

## 🌞 3. LDR-Based Light Detection

**Description**:  
Use an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) module to detect ambient light and automatically turn an LED ON or OFF.

### 🔧 Components:
- Arduino UNO
- LDR Sensor Module (with digital output)
- LED (or use built-in LED on pin 13)
- Jumper Wires

### 🔍 Features:
- Detects light vs. dark environments
- Digital input means no analog processing needed
- Can be extended for street light automation

### 📺 Demo:
